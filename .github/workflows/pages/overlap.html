Our Capstone is a year long undergraduate project which I worked together with Adrinna Williams. Our purpose is to create 
a social networking webpage that focuses on user interaction, communication, and content sharing by providing users with an accessible application 
and website to help them find friends. This online platform allows user to share similar interests, passions, and hopefully free time to interact through our application.
A difficulty we often face in communication is attempting to discover a shared hobby among friends. This 
can be somewhat difficult to approach from conversation, especially if one is particularly shy.

</p><br>

<p>
We name our website Overlap intended to help users find friends with overlapping interests by making each user's chosen hobbies 
publicly avaliable through their profile page. The goal is to bring people who would never otherwise meet each other become closer together and help them be more fulfilled with their passions by sharing them with others, whether these passions be online gaming, reading, moviews, role-playing, or sports, etc.

<b>Project Management</b> <br><br>
Before development begin, managerial process took place to clearly define our project responsibilities 
including timeline establishment, organization structure, risk1 management, architecture design, deployment, user interface, and associated technical processes. 

The purpose is to provide guidelines for managing Overlap development by outline its internal data flow 
in terms of processing, storage, and trnasmission of information. We generated project management artifacts to 
guide us through system construction. Including project workspace, project identification, change control, configuration, and status reporting. 

<br><br>

Team lead (myself) is responsible for coordinating deliverables with status updates, communications and accuiring necessary resources by the due date. 
The project is developed by utilizing the Waterfall technique, tools such as JIRA and Garnet Chart are been used. 
Task and activities are equally distributed among team member according to personal expertise. Finally, an object oriented analysis with code testing methologies 
are performed for quality assurance purpose. </p><br>

<b>Architecture Design</b><br>
Our priotity is to understand user needs, which we performed rounds of use-case and requirement evaluations to determine 
quantifiable, relevant, and detailed features that we are capable to implement. Five components are involved in the 
application setup<br><br>
&emsp; Administrator - development team given admin right to manage all established user accounts with code modification right<br>
&emsp; User Interface - Graphical system enhances user experience with intuitive design that requires minimum effort to navigate our functions<br>
&emsp; Web Server - computer used to host relavent functions through web page by store, process, and deliver Overlap contents to end users<br>
&emsp; Database - MySQL used to store and organize user information in an accessible manner<br>
&emsp; End Users - anyone who wishes to join Overlap or wishes to use Overlap functions<br><br> </p><br>

Overlap is to be developed as a website accessible by users with a username and password. 
It consists of the internet established web server connected to database. When a user logs in or searches for other users, 
the system accesses the database retriving necessary information to authenticate or return results respectively. We set system constraints as 
initial information required from user registration given the following requirements (sample draw from requirement document):<br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
&emsp; A user shall be a registered member of Overlap in order to login and access further web services<br>
&emsp; The user shall be able to see the login screen upon opening of Overlap<br>
&emsp; The user shall be able to see an icon indicating to receive support or help instructions for the 
page<br>
&emsp; Users shall be prompted to optionally reset their password after three failed login attempts<br>
&emsp; The user shall not have replicated cell phone number, and email address provided<br>
&emsp; Overlap shall prompt an interest “Overlap Discovery Survey” upon registration<br>
&emsp; The user shall be redirected to the homepage upon successful login<br>
&emsp; Overlap shall incorporate Two-Factor Authentication for login with email and phone number<br>
&emsp; The user shall be able to search persons by username<br>
&emsp; The user shall be able to search persons by interest tag<br>
&emsp; Overlap shall be able to match according to interest tag<br>
&emsp; The user shall be able to comment on paired users post<br>
&emsp; The user shall see an availability schedule of the user from selecting their profile<br> <p>
</p><br>

<b>Site Features</b><br><br>

Overlap has three primary functions, 
pairing, communication, and the User Profiles.<br><br>
<u> User Pairing </u>is one of our most unique features. Upon user request, system matches two users with shared interests 
and pairs them to chat! The algorithm check user interest tag and automatically matches existing user in the database with 
highest percentage of similarities. When one user using the Website’s search functions attempts to communicate with a paired user who shares similar interest either via a private message to said user, or other methods made known to the user via the paired user’s profile, such as their Discord, Twitter, or other social network accounts.
User’s may make information about themselves public for other users to see, such as alternate contact methods, their open schedule, interests, and may choose how much information is shared publicly, with friends, and with specific friends, in case users find certain information to be worth keeping private.

<br><br>
<u>Event Scheduler</u> is a calander feature Overlap offers for planning interactive plays with friends. Overlap uses 
Full Calendar plugin for this feature where user may indicate and view friends free time to fully engage in group activities. 
To do so, user may modify dates and times on Calendar such as insert, delete, or reschedule events as desired. These modifications are synced with database.<br><br>

<u>Real-Time Chat</u> Communication increases self-esteem, builds connection and establish good friendship. Our real-time chat enables live communication among users. Consisting of page quick chat window and chatroom uilt 
specifically for interactive communication with friends. Overlap also offers design customization where user may 
select preferenced color design. Fun-box functions (emoji) are also offered to better engage with friends with chatting 
histories stored in database for tracking purpose.

<b>Security Implementation</b><br><br>
An important goal of Overlap is to secure user data. Two-Factor authentication is used including 
session variable, form methods, and XXL measures taken to protect our data. Furthermore, SQL prevention measures are 
implemented at code level. Possible future improvement would be implementing hashed database password to help protect 
against attackers. An 18-digit authentication code is randomly generated and sent to user email that was registered with their Overlap account. 
Successful verification authenticates user credentials through use of SESSION variable to enhance the 
confidentiality of our user.

<b>Sample Screenshots</b><br><br>
<u>Having Overlap been one of our early school project, the site is no longer hosted </u>due to lack of maintenance effort and potential resource constraints. 
The development for Overlap was not flawless. In fact, few bugs still remain, despite multiple changes and rework that took place. However, our team is very pround of ourselves 
for the completion of our development. The following images presents screenshots of the running site.
